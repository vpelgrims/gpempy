		    Galactic Polarized EMission in PYthon

***

``gpempy`` has been developed in the framework of the [RADIOFOREGROUNDS](https://radioforegrounds.eu) project to reconstruct the large-scale magnetic field of the Milky Way through the observation and analysis of the diffuse polarized emission measured at submillimeter wavelengths by cosmic microwave brackground experiments.

Specifically, ``gpempy`` is a simulation software to create full-sky maps of the synchrotron and thermal dust polarized emission based on three-dimensional parameteric models to describe at large scales the Galactic Magnetic Field and matter density distribution (relativistic electron and dust grain).

``gpempy`` is divided in four modules:
- BFIELD to estimate and visualize GMF models
- GalacticProfile to estimate and visualize models of matter density distribution
- GalacticForegrounds to estimate differential emission and produce full-sky maps of the integrated emission
- GalaxyBasics to handle space grid, coordinate transforms, etc.

``gpempy`` is modular and can be used to visualize and access models in a user-friendly way.
More general information on gpempy can be read [here](GeneralDoc.md).
